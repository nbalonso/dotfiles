# My dotfiles

#### My setup:

 * Primarily running OS X
 * [SourceCodePro](https://github.com/powerline/fonts) font
 * [iTerm2](https://iterm2.com)
 * [powerline](https://github.com/powerline/powerline) for my Vim and bash prompts
 * [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim) for managing my Vim plugins
 * [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to get tools
 * [Atom](https://atom.io) for my UI editing

Some things I tend to get from brew `grc bash bash-completion wget nmap tree openssl john-jumbo pdsh augeas iperf4 exiftool ssh-copy-id python vim --with-python --with-ruby --with-perl grep --with-default-names`

To get powerline in OS X:
 1. Get a decent python version
`brew install python`
 2. Upgrade pip itself
`pip install --upgrade pip`
 3. Get powerline installed to system
`pip install git+git://github.com/powerline/powerline`
 4. Verify it
`ll ll /usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages/powerline`


Never finished and always a work in progress.
